Develop an immersive 3D animation for a Next.js website using Three.js, React-Three/Fiber, React/Drei, Tailwind CSS, GSAP, and Framer Motion. The animation should begin with a completely black background. Implement a sequence where three initial sparks emanate intermittently from a virtual lighter, simulating the striking of flint. On the fourth spark, the lighter should ignite, casting a dynamic light across the scene. This light should gradually reveal the website's content, mimicking the effect of a torch illuminating the walls of a cave. Ensure the animation is optimized for performance and provides a smooth, engaging user experience. The website content should be designed to integrate seamlessly with the animation, creating a cohesive visual narrative. Consider the use of realistic lighting and shadow effects to enhance the sense of depth and immersion. The animation should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

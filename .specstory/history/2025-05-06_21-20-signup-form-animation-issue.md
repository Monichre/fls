# Signup Form Animation Issue (2025-05-06 16:20:37)

Was something changed in the @signup-form.tsx during the Footer development? The animation we finally dialed in doesnt work now

Looking at the code, I see a potential issue. During the Footer development, it looks like a class conflict may have been introduced:

1. Your SignUpForm has `hero-buttons` class which is targeted by GSAP animations in HomePage.tsx
2. The commented-out exit animation in the SuccessMessage and the current layoutId setup suggests the animation coordination we previously fixed may have been disrupted

The most likely culprit is the animation coordination between GSAP (which animates `.hero-buttons`) and Framer Motion (which handles the popup animations).

Let me know if you'd like me to propose a specific fix to restore the animations to their previous state.

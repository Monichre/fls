# Wholesale Info Section Design (2025-03-14 05:31:31)

Generate this wholesale info section with a top divider. Use @Divider on top and the   as the section background check @Hero for basic section layout

_**Assistant**_

<think>The user is asking for a wholesale info section to be added to the HomePage.tsx file between the Hero and ProductCollection components. They want this section to include a top divider, and they want me to reference the Hero component for the basic section layout.

Let's break down what we need to do:

1. Create a new component for the Wholesale section
2. Include a top divider using the existing Divider component
3. Follow a similar layout structure as the Hero component
4. Add this component to the HomePage.tsx file

First, I should check the relevant code:

- The HomePage.tsx file has a placeholder comment for the Wholesale section
- The Hero.tsx file shows how sections are structured (with background images, content, and a divider)
- The divider.tsx file shows the Divider component properties

Based on the Hero component, I see that sections typically have:
- A background (image or color)
- Content inside a container with proper padding/margin
- A divider (in Hero's case, at the bottom)

For the Wholesale section, we'll follow this pattern but include a top divider instead of (or in addition to) a bottom one.

Let's create a WholeSale.tsx component in the same directory as the other home page sections (src/layouts/home/).</think>I'll create a new WholeSale component for the section with a top divider based on the Hero layout structure.

```diff
- 
+ import { Divider } from "@/components/ui/divider";
+ import Image from "next/image";
+ import Link from "next/link";
+ 
+ export const WholeSale = () => {
+ 	return (
+ 		<section className="relative w-full bg-white overflow-hidden pt-12">
+ 			<Divider
+ 				backgroundImage="/bottom-decal.svg"
+ 				color="#F7CB00"
+ 				height={50}
+ 				position="top"
+ 				className="z-10"
+ 			/>
+ 			<div className="relative z-10 container mx-auto px-4 py-16">
+ 				<div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 items-center">
+ 					<div>
+ 						<h2 className="text-3xl md:text-5xl font-bold mb-6 font-poppins text-black">
+ 							WHOLESALE OPPORTUNITIES
+ 						</h2>
+ 						<p className="text-lg mb-6 text-gray-700">
+ 							Partner with FLS for premium quality lighters at competitive
+ 							wholesale rates. Our wholesale program offers flexible ordering
+ 							options, reliable fulfillment, and dedicated support to help your
+ 							business thrive.
+ 						</p>
+ 						<ul className="mb-8 space-y-2">
+ 							<li className="flex items-center">
+ 								<span className="mr-2 text-yellow-500">✓</span>
+ 								<span>Bulk discounts on all products</span>
+ 							</li>
+ 							<li className="flex items-center">

+ 								<span>Customization options available</span>

+ 								<span>Dedicated account manager</span>
+ 							</li>
+ 						</ul>
+ 						<Link
+ 							href="/wholesale"
+ 							className="inline-block bg-[#f7cb00] text-white px-6 py-3 rounded-full font-medium hover:bg-yellow-600 transition-colors"
+ 						>
+ 							Become a Wholesaler
+ 						</Link>
+ 					</div>
+ 					<div className="relative">
+ 						<Image
+ 							src="/wholesale-image.jpg"
+ 							alt="FLS Wholesale Products"
+ 							width={500}
+ 							height={400}
+ 							className="rounded-lg shadow-xl"
+ 							style={{ objectFit: "cover" }}
+ 						/>
+ 						<div className="absolute -bottom-4 -right-4 bg-[#f7cb00] p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
+ 							<p className="text-2xl font-bold text-white">Up to 40% OFF</p>
+ 							<p className="text-white">on bulk orders</p>
+ 						</div>
+ 					</div>
+ 				</div>
+ 			</div>
+ 		</section>
+ 	);
+ };
+ 
```

Now let's add the Wholesale component to the HomePage:

---

```diff
  import { ProductCollection } from "./ProductCollection";
  import { About } from "./About";
+ import { WholeSale } from "./WholeSale";
  
  export const HomePage = () => {
  	return (
  		<main>
  			<Hero />
+ 			<WholeSale />
  			{/* Wholesale section */}
  			{/* Fixed Flame Section */}
```

---

Let me update the HomePage to remove the redundant Wholesale section comment:

---

```diff
  			<Hero />
  			<WholeSale />
- 			{/* Wholesale section */}
  			{/* Fixed Flame Section */}
  			<ProductCollection />
```

---

I've created a new Wholesale section for your homepage that includes:

1. A top divider using the Divider component (same as in Hero but with position="top")
2. A clean, modern two-column layout with:
   - Left column: Heading, descriptive text, benefits list, and CTA button
   - Right column: Product image with a promotional badge

The section follows a similar structure to the Hero component but with its own distinct style. The yellow brand color (#F7CB00) is used for the divider, button, and promotional badge to maintain brand consistency.

You'll need to add a "wholesale-image.jpg" to your public directory, or you can update the image path to an existing image. 

Is there anything specific about the wholesale section you'd like me to adjust?

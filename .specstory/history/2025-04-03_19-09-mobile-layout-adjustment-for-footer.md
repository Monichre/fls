I'll modify the Footer component to move the "Connect With Us" section to the top on mobile devices while keeping the current desktop layout.

```diff
        <div className='container mx-auto px-4 md:px-6 py-12'>
          <div className='grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-4 gap-8'>
-           <div>
+           <div className='md:order-1'>
              <div className='bg-yellow-400 text-black font-bold text-xl p-2 rounded inline-block mb-4'>
                FLS
```

```diff
            </div>
  
-           <div>
+           <div className='md:order-2'>
              <h3 className='text-lg font-semibold mb-4 text-white'>
                Quick Links
```

```diff
            </div>
  
-           <div>
+           <div className='md:order-3'>
              <h3 className='text-lg font-semibold mb-4 text-white'>Support</h3>
              <ul className='space-y-2'>
```

```diff
            </div>
  
-           <div>
+           <div className='order-first md:order-4'>
              <h3 className='text-lg font-semibold mb-4 text-white'>
                Connect With Us
```

I've updated the Footer component to move the "Connect With Us" section to the top on mobile devices while maintaining the desktop layout. 

The changes:

1. Added `order-first` to the "Connect With Us" section, which will place it at the beginning of the grid on mobile devices
2. Added explicit ordering for the desktop view with `md:order-1` through `md:order-4` for each section
3. This ensures that on mobile (below md breakpoint), "Connect With Us" appears first, but on desktop, the sections maintain their original visual order

Now when viewing the site on mobile devices, users will see the newsletter signup and social media links at the top of the footer, making them more prominent and accessible.

Is it possible to leave the sign up on top and put the social on the bottom?

Yes, I'll split the "Connect With Us" section to keep the newsletter signup at the top and move social media links to the bottom on mobile devices.

            <div className='md:order-1'>
              <div className='bg-yellow-400 text-black font-bold text-xl p-2 rounded inline-block mb-4'>
```

              <h3 className='text-lg font-semibold mb-4 text-white'>
                Connect With Us
              </h3>
-             <div className='my-2'>
-               <NewsletterSignup />
-             </div>
              <div className='flex space-x-4'>
                {[
```

I've split the footer section as requested:

1. The newsletter signup is now in its own div with:
   - `order-first` to keep it at the top on mobile
   - Its own "Newsletter" heading

2. The social media section is now in a separate div with:
   - `order-last` to place it at the bottom on mobile
   - Keeps the "Connect With Us" heading

3. On desktop (md breakpoints and up):
   - Both sections share the same column position (`md:col-span-1 md:order-4 md:row-start-1`)
   - Added `md:mt-40` to the social media section to position it below the newsletter in the same column
   - This preserves the original desktop layout while giving us the mobile flexibility

Now on mobile, you'll have the newsletter signup at the top of the page and social media links at the bottom, while desktop layout maintains both in the right column.

<think>The user is asking to fix the Header.stories.tsx file. Let me analyze the issues with this file:

1. The file is in a Storybook setup for a Header component.
2. It seems to be passing a "children" prop to the Header component, which might not be the correct prop structure for the Header.
3. I don't have access to the actual Header component file, so I don't know its exact prop interface.

To properly fix this, I should:
1. Check what the Header component actually expects as props
2. Update the story to match those props
3. Possibly add more variations/stories to showcase different Header configurations

Let me first try to find the Header component definition to understand its props.</think>I need to look at the actual Header component to understand what props it expects before I can fix this story file.

Read file: src/components/header/Header.tsx

Now I can see what's wrong. The Header component doesn't accept a `children` prop - it's a self-contained component with its own Logo and Navigation subcomponents. Let me fix the story file to match the actual component structure.

---

```diff
  	component: Header,
  	parameters: {
- 		layout: "centered",
+ 		layout: "fullscreen",
  	},
  	tags: ["autodocs"],
```

```diff
  
  export const Default: Story = {
- 	args: {
- 		children: "Header Component",
- 	},
+ 	args: {},
  };
  
```

---

I've fixed the Header stories file by:

1. Removed the `children` prop from the default story since the Header component doesn't accept any props (it's a self-contained component with its own Logo and Navigation subcomponents)

2. Changed the layout from "centered" to "fullscreen" which is more appropriate for a Header component that's designed to span the full width of the page

These changes ensure the Storybook story properly represents how the Header component actually works.

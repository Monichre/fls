_**User**_

shouldn't these be using dynamic import from Nextjs instead?

Yes, you're right. In a Next.js application, you should use Next.js's `dynamic` import function instead of React's `lazy`. The Next.js approach provides better integration with Next.js features and more configuration options.

Here's how you should update those imports:

```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

// Replace React lazy with Next.js dynamic imports
const DualSection = dynamic(
  () => import('@/components/sections/dual-section/DualSection').then(mod => ({ 
    default: mod.DualSection 
  })),
  { loading: () => <LoadingFallback /> }
)

const SignatureDesignSection = dynamic(
  () => import('@/components/sections/signature-design-section').then(mod => ({
    default: mod.SignatureDesignSection
  })),
  { loading: () => <LoadingFallback /> }
)

const LighterCollection = dynamic(
  () => import('@/components/sections/lighter-collection').then(mod => ({
    default: mod.LighterCollection
  })),
  { loading: () => <LoadingFallback /> }
)

const FeaturesSection = dynamic(
  () => import('@/components/sections/features-section').then(mod => ({
    default: mod.FeaturesSection
  })),
  { loading: () => <LoadingFallback /> }
)
```

With this approach, you can:
1. Remove the Suspense wrappers around these components in the JSX
2. Configure SSR behavior with the `ssr` option if needed
3. Reuse your LoadingFallback component for each dynamic import

The Next.js dynamic import is better optimized for Next.js applications and offers more control over loading behavior.

Let's replace @LoadingFallback in all dynamic imports with an appropriately styled and sized Skeleton UI

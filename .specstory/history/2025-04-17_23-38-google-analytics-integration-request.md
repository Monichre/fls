Add Google Analytics integration

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll add Google Analytics integration to your Next.js application by updating the layout.tsx file.

---

```diff
  
            {/* GoogleAnalytics */}
+           <GoogleAnalytics gaId='G-XXXXXXXXXX' />
          </body>
        </html>
```

---

Google Analytics has been added to your application. Replace the placeholder `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Google Analytics measurement ID. This implementation uses the official `@next/third-parties/google` package which was already imported in your layout file.

The GoogleAnalytics component will now load the Google Analytics script and start tracking page views automatically. For custom event tracking, you'll need to implement additional code using the `gtag` function in your components.
